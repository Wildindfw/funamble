Funamble is a PHP Tumble Log & Tumblr Clone.

The first part of the experiment was simply to see what could be built in two hours.
Excluding a CMS, a workable Tumblr like environment was the result, with capacity for Text and Picture posts with skin support.

No installer as yet, barely installable on any other platform, but INSTALL.SQL does exist. 

Check index.php for everything else!
